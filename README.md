Intro to Evolutionary Modeling
==============================

Material for teaching biologists to work with digital evolutionary models.

The IPython Notebook in this directory walks students through a paper that uses an
evolutionary digital model. It introduces the study, briefly explains the model, then
tasks the student with learning how to translate model explanations in text into code.
The notebook contains a basic implementation of the model so the students can explore
the model and the evolutionary effects of various model parameters.
