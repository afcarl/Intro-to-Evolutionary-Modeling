      "#Animal Foraging and the Evolution of Goal-Directed Cognition\n",
      "\n",
      "In this 2006 paper, Thomas Hills explored the evolution of an optimal foraging behavior called area-restricted search (ARS):\n",
      "\n",
      ">ARS is characterized by a concentration of searching effort around areas where rewards in\n",
      "the form of specific resources have been found in the past. When resources are encountered\n",
      "less frequently, behavior changes such that the search becomes less sensitive, but covers more\n",
      "space. In an ecological context, animals using ARS will turn more frequently following an\n",
      "encounter with food, restricting their search around the area where food was last encountered. As\n",
      "the period of time since the last food encounter increases, animals turn less frequently and\n",
      "begin to move away, following a more linear path. Fig. 1 allows you to experience ARS in a visual\n",
      "search task (read the directions please).\n",
      "\n",
      "<center><img src=\"files/RAS-Figure.png\" width=\"800px\" /></center>\n",
      "\n",
      "You can read more about ARS and Hills' work in the paper. (Free to download: \n",
      "http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/thills/thills/hills-forcog.pdf). \n",
      "Here, we're interested in the model that Hills used to explore the evolutionary\n",
      "feasibility of ARS in various environments:\n",
      "    \n",
      ">To further test the evolutionary robustness of this behavior, I developed a genetic algorithm, using NetLogo, that allows agents to search for food in a two-dimensional space. The goal of the genetic algorithm is twofold: to understand the conditions where ARS is likely to evolve and also to understand a minimal set of mechanistic parameters required for the behavior\u2019s evolution. In this simulation, the agents have three genes that control turning angle per time step when they are \u201con food,\u201d turning angle per time step when they are \u201coff food,\u201d and a memory depth that describes the number of time steps it takes for the animals to progress from the on-food to the off-food turning angle once they have left food (the inverse of memory depth is the slope of change in turning angle per time step). The initial population is generated with a random 24-bit genome per individual (8 bits per gene). The genes assign the foraging rules each generation. Animals then compete in a two-dimensional foraging arena. After an appropriate life span, individuals mate and recombine\u2014disproportionately according to how well they foraged\u2014and a new generation is created, subject to a small mutation rate.\n",
      "    \n",
      "Following good practice, Hills also included a link to an implementation of the model: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/ARS-Genetics\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's say we're animal behavior researchers who specialize in ARS and we want to explore Hills' findings a little more in his model. Unfortunately, NetLogo doesn't work on our computer, so we have the re-implement the model ourselves. Below is one such implementation of Hills' model in Python using IPythonBlocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Homework\n",
      "    \n",
      "1) Read through the Python code and write comments taking note of where Hills' description matches the code. Does this implementation do anything differently than described in Hills' text?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Run the model for 100 generations and observe how the forager behavior evolves over that time period. Does ARS evolve? How quickly does it evolve?\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Run the model a few more times for 100 generations each and observe how the forager behavior evolves over that time period. Does ARS evolve? Does it evolve faster or slower than the other runs?\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Change the number of food patches, `num_patches`, and size of the food patches, `patch_size`, and run the model again. Does ARS evolve with those settings? Repeat this procedure several times. Can you find settings that cause ARS to no longer evolve?\n",
      "\n",
      "5) It's important to run evolutionary models several times to make sure that the phenomenon you observe isn't simply due to chance. Fortunately, it's easy to repeat evolutionary models several times in replicate in a short amount of time. Modify the Python code to run the model with default settings in replicate 30 times, save the data from each run separately, and plot the mean of the fitness and traits for those 30 replicates over all 100 generations with 95% confidence intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Repeat #5 except with settings that do not select for the evolution of ARS behavior. Plot the mean and 95% confidence interval of the fitness and traits of these runs on the same plot as #5. What traits are different between the two experiments? Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "7) What do these findings entail in biological terms?\n",
      "\n",
      "8) What are the limitations of this model?\n",
      "\n",
      "9) What are some possible extensions of this model? What other questions could be explored with this model?\n",
      "\n",
      "Bonus) Find a quantitative measure that captures how much the forager follows an area-restricted search. Plot it over evolutionary time for an experiment that evolves ARS."
